"""FastAPI application entrypoint for the seat management backend.

This module assembles the HTTP application used by the backend service. It is
responsible for loading runtime configuration, configuring cross-origin access
for the frontend client, registering route groups, normalizing HTTP error
payloads, and performing startup-time database maintenance required by the
authentication and SSO flows.

Key dependencies include FastAPI for request handling, the shared settings
loader for environment-backed configuration, the database connection factory,
and repository helpers that keep authentication-related tables in sync with the
expectations of the API layer.
